Introducing the new and improved Canine Cupid, this application builds up Canine Cupid V1, well "builds upon" is a strong phrase... this application is an entire rework of the OG, including a re-work of the style, a new array to store user's matches, mapping of match yes array to display personalized messages from each user, IP address feature, functioning geolocation, and much more!
